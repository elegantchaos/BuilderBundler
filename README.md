# Projects

A Builder tool which makes an application package or a library bundle from a target.

This is a rough hack and doesn't work right now.

Objectives:

- allow the creation of applications and libraries with Builder
- infer as much information as possible about the bundle from the context
- use standard file layout patterns (like spm does) to help with this inference
- for things we can't infer, substitute them in from the environment / builder config / (another file?)
